Account Filter
##############

:doc:`Accounts<account>` may configure account properties, a set of smart rules to receive transactions only from an allowed list of addresses. Similarly, an account can specify a list of addresses that donâ€™t want to receive transactions from.

When these pair of lists are empty, all accounts can send transactions to the stated account.

  Address filter

The same behavior can be applied to allow or block receiving transactions containing a given :doc:`mosaic id<mosaic>` or only allowing sending certain :ref:`transactions by type<transaction-types>`.

Blocking spam transactions
==========================

A company is using the public chain to certify the quality of their products.

When the quality verification process concludes, an operator sends a :doc:`quality seal<mosaic>` to the product account.

The final customers can review the product mosaics scanning a QR code. For that reason, the company only wants to show related transactions, avoiding others to spam their products with non-related information.

  Blocking spam transactions

The company opts to configure their product accounts filters, enabling only to receive transactions containing "company.quality:seal" mosaics.

Enhancing the account security
==============================

Lately, Alice is only using her main account to cosign aggregate transactions where a :doc:`multisig<multisig>` she is a cosignatory is involved.

As a temporary measure, Alice opts to disable announcing transfer transactions from  her main account, double checking that any of the funds she owns will be transferred.
