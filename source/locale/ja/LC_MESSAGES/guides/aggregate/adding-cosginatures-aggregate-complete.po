"This can be useful for when you are keeping your private keys in an "

"cosignatures offline, the cosignatories will be able to execute "
"transactions from your cold wallet while keeping their private keys "
"completely safe. Furthermore, it also allows users to avoid unnecessarily"
" locking their funds in :ref:`aggregate bonded transactions <aggregate-"
